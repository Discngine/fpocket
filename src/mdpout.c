## GENERAL INFORMATION

## FILE 					mdpout.c.
## AUTHORS					P. Schmidtke and V. Le Guilloux
## LAST MODIFIED			28-11-10
##
## SPECIFICATIONS
##
##	This file implements a memory handler. Whenever you call
##	my_bloc_malloc function, the allocated pointer will be
##	stored in a simple chained list. Then, if a malloc fails,
##	or if you call the my_exit function, all allocated variable
##	will be freed if not NULL of course. Therefore, a bloc
##	allocated by my_... functions MUST be freed by the my_free,
##	or a double free error should appears.
##
##	WARNING
##
##	This is an easy way to handle memory. However, if many bloc
##	are allocated and removed during the programm, it might be
##	solwed down as for each free, as we have to look for the bloc
##	to free in the list, and remove it.
##
##	REMEMBER: if you use my_malloc, you MUST use my_free. If you
##	free a bloc allocated by my_(..), and if you call free_all at
##	the end, a double free coprruption will occure.
